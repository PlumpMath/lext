**Project: Lext** 

A physics based puzzle game made in Panda3d.

General Idea:
You must collect the needed parts in order to move to the next level.  Key Cards and "Fuse boxes". Key cards are for doors and other sensors.  Fuse boxes are like power cells, thats used to power certain things in the game. Like lifts, doors, lights etc.

- The character can pickup "Key Cards".
- Fuse boxes can only be pushed around or moved via a device.
- A device can be placed by a player. The idea is that the player should be able to adjust the force/gravity of the device field.  The player can only carry a certain amount of devices.
- At a later stage the player will have a physics box creator gun aswell. In which the player could create objects to aid in whatever, depending on energy which the gun needs.
- Possible AI.
